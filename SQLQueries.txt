WITH tmp AS (SELECT Occupation, MIN(Age) AS minage
            FROM Customer_advises  
            GROUP BY Occupation) 
SELECT tmp.Occupation, tmp.minage
FROM tmp
WHERE tmp.minage < (SELECT AVG(tmp.minage) FROM tmp);

FROM Manage_MSC mmsc 
WHERE NOT EXISTS

     MINUS
    (SELECT hm2.ManagerID
     FROM Has_Manager hm2 
     WHERE hm2.Name_MSC = mmsc.Name_MSC AND hm2.CEO = mmsc.CEO));

-Aggregation with Group By:
Find the maximum age for each occupations: 
SELECT Occupation,MAX(age) AS maxage
FROM Customer_advises
